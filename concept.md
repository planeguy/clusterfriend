#Basic Concept
I love social networks, but I hate the people who run them beacause invariably they fuck them up trying to monetize them. I want to host my own network for just me & my friends, free of any corporate bullshit. More in the spirit of usenet, but with more not-text.

So in a rant on the Rudram Thread, I said: 


In that spirit I offer this alternative: the decentralized social network.

##Um something?
List of friends -> Query friend URL for updates -> Collate locally
Essentally, clusterfriend is a complex sysyem to filter posts by user

##Security & Privacy
Right now I'm thinking that getting a secure, signed cerificate from a user's home server (ala openid) is appropriate for verifying a user's identity. Whether that is actually an OpenID implementation or not, I haven't decided yet.
It could be as simple as having to make a basic user account with password on a given user's home server?
