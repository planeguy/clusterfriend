#Basic Concept
I love social networks, but I hate the people who run them beacause invariably they fuck them up trying to monetize them. I want to host my own network for just me & my friends, free of any corporate bullshit. More in the spirit of usenet, but with more not-text.

So in a rant on the [Rudram Thread](https://www.facebook.com/chris.rudram/posts/10153870108165247), I said: 

>"fuck bookface. we should all go back to blogging with rss feeds in a distributed fashion. I mean seriously, we developed a decentralized, robust network of connected servers AND a really simple syndication format for dissemination of information, only to end up putting all our shit on some corporations server cluster with the faint hope they won't curate my photos of dinner out of your feed."

Easier said than done, but in that spirit started this project: a decentralized social network. I'm sure someone has thought of this before, but I've yet to find it.

List of friends -> Query friend URL for updates -> Collate locally

I would imagine it like rss feeds but with a focus on short posts and being able to reference other posts. Yes I know trying to compete with RSS/Atom is dumb.

#Encryped for multiple recipients
The basic idea is that everything is encrypted. For space and sanity's sake let's limit friend lists? Something nerdy like 128 or 256?
posts can be:

1. all friends
2. specific friends
3. public

An update feed would be able to communicate new posts and their intended recipients (or "all friends"). 

Public feeds are seperate as they are not encrypted in any way. If they follow the standard, then they should still be readable by clusterfriend clients.

#The Bad News
After some experimentaion, you can see in (./sizes/quick-maths.md) that the data downloads are rather large. Either the "just an rss file" is not totaly feasible and a smarter service is required or more research is needed.
##Possible Solutions
###Smaller batch size
less to download at once, but prolific users will still pump out a ton of updates. They might pump them out faster than you can download and you'd miss some. We can fix this with a previous property on the feed, but still.
###Expiring session key + smallest batch size (1)
we actually get rid of "feeds" and just have a "last post" entry point. The last post will have a previous link to the previous item. It'd make downloading slow if you haven't gotten updates in a while, though since updates would be downloaded individually. Every update would be encrypted with the same session key, available somewhere else on the server.
###Feed batch size selection
the entry point actually is a series of feed digests with the latest update date listed as a property. for example:
    ```JSON
    {
        "03-11-2015T14:00:00.0Z":"http://cf.delek.org/planeguy/digests/1",
        "03-11-2015T14:00:00.0Z":"http://cf.delek.org/planeguy/digests/5",
        "03-11-2015T08:00:00.0Z":"http://cf.delek.org/planeguy/digests/10",
        "02-11-2015T20:00:00.0Z":"http://cf.delek.org/planeguy/digests/25",
        "01-11-2015T18:00:00.0Z":"http://cf.delek.org/planeguy/digests/50",
        "01-11-2015T06:00:00.0Z":"http://cf.delek.org/planeguy/digests/100"
    }
    ```
The downside is that now posting an update requires regenerating these files. It's a good job for a service, but if we're gonna have a service, then we might as well go full service.

###A little more techincal
I think it would be totally feasible to just use OpenPGP (minus keyrings & trusted verifiers) to encrypt a public feed resource, and additionally any private posts within. 
```
GET http://cf.delek.org/
```
returns would return user info, including their public key and a link to their feed resource.
```
GET http://cf.delek.org/feed
```

The feed is OpenPGP encrypted and would decypts to something like
```JSON
[
	{
		"date":"03-11-2015T14:00:00.0Z",
		"user":"http://cf.delek.org/planeguy",
		"public":{
			"url":"http://cf.delek.org/planeguy/posts/1",
			"relates":[{
				"replies-to":"http://cf.delek.org/chanceula/posts/1"
			}]
		}
	},
    {
    "etc":"etc"
    }
]
```
If something in the feed is not meant for all friends, it is encrypted before adding it to the feed, so you get:
```JSON
	{
		"date":"03-11-2015T14:00:00.0Z",
		"user":"http://cf.delek.org/planeguy",
		"private":"ENCRYPTED-POST-WITH-SESSION-KEYS-FOR-SPECIFIC-USERS"
		}
	}
```
At the post's permalink, the format is similar, but with actual content. It is encrypted again at the permalink.
```JSON
{
	"date":"03-11-2015T14:00:00.0Z",
	"user":"http://cf.delek.org/planeguy",
	"post":{
		"url":"http://cf.delek.org/planeguy/posts/1",
		"relates":{
			"replies-to":"http://cf.delek.org/chanceula/posts/1"
		},
		"content":"STUFF"
	}
}
```
##Not-encryption techinical
###Polling for updates
When polling for updates, the client app should send a either an If-None-Match or If-Modified-Since header in the traditional RSS way.
