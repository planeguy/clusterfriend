# Note on JSON-LD Schemas

## No schemas for item-management
Item management schemes are a real iffy part of it right now as far as posiible values and also it uses JSON in a *really JSON* way.
Meanwhile, JSON-LD looks like it's been taken over by RDF purists so it's very much STATIC TUPLES AND LINKS OR **DIE**, so these kind of constructs don't work well in it.
JSON-LD does work great for linking items (it's as if they were some sort of linked data), so using it for those work great.

I think it'll come down to what clients support what item management schemes and also whta schemes become popular or even are invented in the future.
