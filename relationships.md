##Suggested Uses
The relationships allow the disconnected posts to act more like a social network. You can display the relationships before loading the main content.

[planeguy] replied to [pixelante]'s post
"[chanceula] said she's working saturday for an accessioning party. how does sunday sound?"
tags: [chanceula]
```
You could also not load any linked content and only show relationships:
```

Relationships also allow client programs to create context...
```
[planeguy] replied to [pixelante]'s post
pixelante: "still wanna see that movie with benedict cumberbatch. who's in? saturday?"
planeguy: "[chanceula] said she's working saturday for an accessioning party. how does sunday sound?"
tags: [chanceula]
```
A good client would be able to cache content that was used or seen recently and use it to add conext without making another network call.
