#Quick Maths
##100 Posts to 255 People
- Encrypted: 83Kb
- Encryped then gzipped: 63kb
###25 Friends
I check all of them at once and they all have changes: 1575 = 1.53Mb  
I check all of them every half hour and they all have changes for a day = 1.53MB * 48 = 73.82MB  
I have 1GB data a month and all my friends are constantly posting = 2.23GB HOSED
###255 Friends
I have 255 friends and I check all of them at once and they all have changes: 16065Kb = 15.68MB  
I check all of them every half hour and they all have changes for a day = 15.68MB * 48 = 752.64MB  
I have 1GB data a month and all my friends are constantly posting = 22.785GB SO FUCKIN HOSED
###But if we can figure out how to only send new posts
If they each send 100 posts a day, that's only 1.5MB a day for 25 and 15.68MB a day for 255 friends.  
I have 1GB data a month and all my friends are constantly posting = 46.5MB for 25 and 486.08MB for 255.
##My phone says Facebook
Has done 79Mb in 3 days, including me clicking on shit, which is 1/3rd the data of 25 friends in clusterfriend
